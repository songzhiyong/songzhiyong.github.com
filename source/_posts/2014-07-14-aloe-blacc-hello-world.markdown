![HELLO WORLD](/images/2014/07/aleo-blacc-hello-world.jpg "hello world")<br/>

[Verse]

Hello world, it's nice to meet you

I've been waiting for this moment all my life

Hello world, the past is over

It's time for us to come together and make the future right


[Pre-Chorus]

I had an epiphany one night 

Looking at the endless star-filled sky


[Chorus]

The world is ours

The world is ours

The world is ours

Seven billion stars

(We are we are we are we are)

(We are we are we are we are)

The world is ours


[Verse]

Hello world, the sun is rising

It doesn't matter who you are, the sun still sets the same

Hello world, undivided

Don't matter if you win or lose, it


[Chorus]

The world is ours

The world is ours

The world is ours

Seven billion stars

(We are we are we are we are)

(We are we are we are we are)

The world is ours


[Bridge]

From the sky to the sea to the air that we breathe

To the depths of the earth to the stars

The world is ours, all ours

The world is ours, all ours


[Chorus]

(We are we are we are we are)

(We are we are we are we are)

The world is ours

Sometimes, we don't need to understand everything. We just need to have a little faith. For everything you have missed, you have gained something else; And for everything you gain, you lose something else. It's about your outlook towards your life. You can either regret or rejoice. But for the rainy and cloudy, we would not enjoy the blue sky and fresh air.<br><br> <b>Just have a little faith! Good Day, Every Day!</b>
